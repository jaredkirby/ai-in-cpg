## Gradually, then all of a sudden

Text-to-Image

All images were generated with Midjourney. An AI that utilizes transformer and diffusion models to generate images based on a text input.

**Prompt:** _"Photography shot through an outdoor window of a coffee shop with neon sign lighting, window glares and reflections, depth of field, grandpa in a suit with a cup of coffee, portrait, kodak portra 800, 105 mm f1.8"_

# Broad Impact

---

- Use a chart to visualize the $2.6 - $4.4 trillion impact and how it doubles AI's economic effect.
- Caption: "Doubling the Economic Power of AI"

Generative AI could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, increasing the total impact of AI by 15-40%. This is equivalent to roughly doubling AI's economic impact.
