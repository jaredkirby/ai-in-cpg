Gradually, then all of a sudden

Advancements in AI are happening very quickly.
The relevance of information in this deck WILL also change.

We're at the beginning of a very steep exponential.

---
Gradually, then all of a sudden.

A good way to conceptualize (solidify) the rate of advancement is in text-to-image generation.

All images were generated with Midjourney. An AI that utilizes transformer and diffusion models to generate images based on a text input.

Prompt: "Photography shot through an outdoor window of a coffee shop with neon sign lighting, window glares and reflections, depth of field, grandpa in a suit with a cup of coffee, portrait, kodak portra 800, 105 mm f1.8"

Gradually, then all of a sudden.

Version 1 - February 2022

Rough start, but is impressive when considering what is happening.
More of an impressionist painting than a photograph, tho.

---

Gradually, then all of a sudden.

Version 2 - April 2022 (2 months after v1)

Still very far off from the prompt intention, but better depth of field, reflections, and a fully formed person!

Gradually, then all of a sudden.

Version 3 - August 2022 (4 months after v2)

The body is better defined, the coffee cup looks more natural, and the neon sign (kinda) makes an appearance. Still doesn't look much like a photograph.

Gradually, then all of a sudden.

Version 4 - November 2022 (3 months after v3)
This is a big jump and was a very impressive upgrade to the generation model when it came out. This version introduced an entirely new codebase and AI architecture.

Good depth of field across the jacket and the background, a fully formed face, a neon sign, and reflections. Looks like an impression of a photograph.

Gradually, then all of a sudden.

Version 5 - March 15th, 2023 (4 months after v4)

This is the step-change. These images could easily be misunderstood for actual photographs. There are still issues, but it takes more than a glance to notice them.

These advancements aren't only taking place in images.

A similar scale of advancement is happening across all generative modalities.

Impact

---
Macro Economic Impact

- Use a chart to visualize the $2.6 - $4.4 trillion impact and how it doubles AI's economic effect.
- Caption: "Doubling the Economic Power of AI"

Generative AI could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, increasing the total impact of AI by 15-40%. This is equivalent to roughly doubling AI's economic impact.

---
Business Function Benefits

- Pie chart or bar graph showing that 75% of the value comes from customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.
- Caption: "Where Generative AI Adds Most Value"

Around 75% of generative AI's value would come from just 4 business functions: 

- customer operations
- marketing and sales
- software engineering
- R&D

It can improve customer interactions, generate creative marketing content, accelerate software development, and enhance R&D processes.

---
Automation and Work Activities

- A comparison graph showing the rise from 50% to 60-70% in automation potential, perhaps broken down by job type.
- Caption: "Revolutionizing Work Activities"

Generative AI could automate 60-70% of time spent on work activities today, up from 50% estimated previously. 

This is due primarily to improved natural language capabilities. Knowledge work and higher wage occupations may be impacted most.
